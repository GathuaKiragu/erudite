                    <p>A student exchange program is a program in which students from a secondary school or university study abroad at one of their institution's partner institutions.[1] A student exchange program may involve international travel, but does
                        not necessarily require the student to study outside of his or her home country. For example, the National Student Exchange program (NSE) offers placements throughout the United States and Canada.[2] Foreign exchange programs provides
                        students with an opportunity to study in a different country and environment experiencing the history and culture of another country.[3] The term "exchange" means that a partner institution accepts a student, but does not necessarily
                        mean that the students have to find a counterpart from the other institution with whom to exchange. Exchange students live with a host family or in a designated place such as a hostel, an apartment, or a student lodging. Costs
                        for the program vary by the country.<br><a href="#">>>learn more>>>></a></p>
